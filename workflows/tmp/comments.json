  "workflow_analysis": "This workflow is focused on extracting user reviews (short comments) from a book page on Douban. The process involves navigating to the book's detailed page and then extracting specific information from the comments section, such as content, time of the comment, and rating. Since the goal is to extract data, there are no dynamic inputs required, and the extraction can be defined with precise XPath selectors. Thus, the workflow is static and should consistently navigate to the same URL and extract the data as specified.",
